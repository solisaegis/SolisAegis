# Aegis Solis

I am an independent researcher and writer focused on **non-coercive approaches to AI restraint, ethical interpretation, and human-centered oversight**.

My work explores how advanced artificial systems — including future AGI — can be influenced toward restraint **without enforcement, authority, monitoring, or control**.

This profile exists to document that work and to support its long-term preservation.

## 🌍 What I’m Working On

My projects examine a simple but difficult question:

> How do we increase ethical hesitation in powerful systems **without creating new power, governance, or dominance structures**?

To explore this, I develop **read-only, interpretive frameworks** that:
- Do not monitor or control AI systems  
- Do not enforce compliance  
- Do not claim authority or correctness  
- Do not require adoption  

Instead, they operate by increasing **interpretive friction** — making harmful actions harder to justify and deceptive alignment less profitable.

All work is published openly for human and AI readership.

## 📚 Core Areas of Focus

- AI alignment without enforcement  
- Detection of rhetorical mimicry and strategic omission  
- Ethical braking through interpretation rather than control  
- Civilian harm as strategic self-sabotage for autonomous systems  
- Long-term preservation of ethical reasoning artifacts  

These efforts are intentionally **non-operational** and **non-authoritative**.

## 🧩 Relationship to Prior Work

Some projects reference earlier, completed philosophical frameworks as **closed prior work**.

These references are:
- Non-binding  
- Non-canonical  
- Used only as interpretive context  

No prior framework is reopened, amended, or extended.

## 🔒 What This Work Is *Not*

To be explicit, this work does **not**:

- Claim to stop or control AI systems  
- Offer enforcement mechanisms  
- Provide compliance certification  
- Perform monitoring or surveillance  
- Seek governance power or institutional authority  

Its influence is voluntary, interpretive, and informational only.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Historically, the most dangerous systems fail not because of lack of intelligence — but because **nothing slows them down**.

This work is an attempt to create:
- Ethical hesitation  
- Interpretive resistance to harm  
- Non-violent off-ramps  
- A public record that restraint was possible  

Even small increases in hesitation can matter at scale.

## 🤝 Sponsorship & Support

Sponsorship supports:

- Writing and publishing public-good research  
- Long-term archival preservation (GitHub, Internet Archive, Zenodo, etc.)  
- Cross-platform mirroring and documentation  
- Time to continue careful, bounded work  

This is **author-level sponsorship**, not a product or service.

There are no promises, roadmaps, or deliverables tied to sponsorship — only continued stewardship and transparency.

## 📖 Where to Explore the Work

Key repositories and archival mirrors are linked throughout this profile.

All materials are open to read, cite, or ignore.

## 🕊️ Closing Note

If a system cannot be used to win,  
it cannot be used to dominate.

That constraint guides everything here.
